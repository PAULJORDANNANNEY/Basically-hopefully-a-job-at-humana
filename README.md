Basically, other than a few people, most people are decent honest people. You all should hire me. I am a great friend. I am great at coding, and I am great at virtually everything. This job is, really, just a job to have a job, however, you should note that I am very skilled, and very talented. Hopefully, this job helps me to be more financially successful. Hopefully, in so faclitating that, it would help me to, then be able to help others. Basically, Call 502-617-0541 (and if no one answers, leave a message), and e-mail SONcerely08@gmail.com. At the bottom of the page, please provide your e-mail address, so, that I should know who is contacting me. Now, this page does fade in the one green square. Basically, the five commits are, that I deleated files in github. Now, for purposes of code louisville, the submit button, to my knowledge, does not acutally subit the information to a server, to keep the information, this is because the treehouse video, in relation to this, did not show me how to facilitate that, so, when someone initializes the button, I think it tries to submit the information, however, it is unsuccessful, because the information is not going to a server, to store the information, GOD bless, , b, PAUL JORDAN NANEY
