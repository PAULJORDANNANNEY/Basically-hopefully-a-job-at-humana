Basically, 
This README.md document is to show what this code is all about. If any of this is inacurate, I have slept since I facilated this code, also, I am around people with unhealthy boundaries. 

index.html
So the first thing about this is that, 

This code might be too intricate for me to facilitate all the aspects of it here on the readme, however, I may highligt the main points. 
As, relates to the capstone project, 

The fist part of index.html file is the header menu, if you will. You will notice that when fixed to smaller screens the browser window, when not in full screen mode and when you shrink it down from right to left, the top menu shrinks into two columns and than three columns. 

The next part are two youtube videos. 

The next we have the h1 which is h1 because I needed to have that text to be larger than the other text. Obviously this is not within header tags and the reason is because when I put it in the header tags it was not as large as when it was outside the header tags. 

Div I guess is to put the text in an exact locaion on the webpage. 

Then starting on line fourtyfour, that is a calculator that I made my own. It should have a number one button, a plus button, a number one button, an equals button, a clear button, it is facilated to calculate my Awesomeness, and can be facilated to calculate at least, that, one, plus one, equals two. 

Lines fifty five to seventy three, is to stylize wording on the page. 

Moving down to at least line sixtyeight. So, this I made it my own. I have a form that you can put your email into. You can click the Submit You E-Mail button, and because treehouse did not show me how to upload the information onto a server, I believe that it does not actually store the information anywhere, it just for some reason, just facilitates you back to the page. 

Then on line eighty down, it has a legal disclaimer video. 

The media querry in the index.html is to style the color of the top and bottom menus. 

Then starting at least on line eighty eight down, it starts the footer menu bar that has three different sizes and moves and shrinks when you have the screen on not full screen and you shrink it by moving it from right to left. 

css.css 
The two sets of media querries are supposed to resize the top and bottom menus. Which, these combinded, meets the bottom two requirements in this section. 
Which, this meets this requirement, You must include a minimum of 2 media queries that create a better layout/user experience. 
This, also, meets this requirement, CSS Features List A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon. 

javascript.js 
This should meet two requirements, the first is the, Choose at least 1 additional item from any of the lists below and implement it in your project, which would be, Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction - must be done with some JavaScript code. , that is facilitated with the javascript file that should hide/show the sentance in the message. 
The second requirement should be met with this, under JavaScript Features List Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least one field (ex: email is in the correct format) and then use that information on your page somehow. For example, display it back to the user on button click, or change a setting on the page based on a section. Having a form that does nothing on clicking Submit or that just refreshes the page is not enough - you must capture the value(s) of the form and use it somehow. , 
The form in javascript should work, and should meet that requirement. Some of the code is a little redundant, like, the form in javascript is, also, in html. Which, as previsously stated, that should be fine since the treehouse videos said that I would not be storing the information, since it was not going to show me how to upload that to a server, and this was confirmed that this was okay by one of my mentors jacob kastensmidt, also, he, messaged me that it did not have to be perfect. 

Also, this has at least 5 commits (which you should be able to go to github and see that in the repository). 

Side note, again, per one of my mentors, jacob kastensmidt, this does not have to be perfect, so, the bottom menu does not shrink to three, to two, to one, it shrinks from three, to a smaller three, to one. 

This should meet all the requirements set forth in the capstone project requirement for code louisville. If you have any questions please call 5026170541, and if no one answers, leave a message, also, text that number, also, e-mail SONcerely08@gmail.com. 

More legal disclaimers, 
the reason why the word humana is not capitalized is because I believe that the word humana with a capital h is copyright material and I do not want to be involved in copyright infringement (also, anything on here that may look like it needs to be capitized that is not is, again, because I do not want to engage in copyright infringement). In the legal term, good faith, I have copyright matarial on this webpage, some, I believe, is owned by the singer, taylor swift, some, I believe, is owned by disney, some, I believe, is owned by wikipedia, and, some, I believe, is owned by other intities. To comply with good faith, the taylor swift song, I have on spotify, I was unable to get the music video on spoitfy, so I got it off of youtube, so, after the fact, with the understanding that I am not able to compensate the singer for the video that was on youtube, nor could I compensate the singer for the song on youtube, nor could could I compesate wikipedia, specfically, for the pictures from wikipedia, nor could I compensate any of the other entities with the other material for their copyright material, this should meet the good faith legal requirement. This is all under the legal guise of good faith and and fair use, please read the legal disclaimers at the end of all three videos.
