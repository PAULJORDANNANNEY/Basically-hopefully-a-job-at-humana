Basically, the two media querries allow the screen to be rotated either vertically or horizonatally and keep the same basic screen structure while adjust for the two alternation screen posions for mobile view. I do have an animation in CSS which makes part screen fade in in full view at 1920px. I have a calculator that will calculate bills. Side Note: I styled the title of the page with title in the head tag so that it is specific to Humana.
